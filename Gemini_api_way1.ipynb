This step ensures the data is accurate and consistent.\n*   **Transforming:** Converting data into a suitable format for analysis. This might involve aggregating data, creating new variables, or standardizing values.\n*   **Modeling:** Applying statistical or machine-learning techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends within the data.\n*   **Discovering useful information:** Identifying significant insights or findings that address the objectives of the analysis.\n*   **Drawing conclusions:** Interpreting the results of the analysis and formulating meaningful conclusions based on the evidence.\n*   **Supporting decision-making:** Providing data-driven insights that can inform business strategies, policy decisions, or other courses of action."
